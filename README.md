# A Slightly Erratic Instrument

This is a control interface for a instrument I've made for an assignment in the "Musical communication and music technology" at KTH.
The assignment was to create a bad/useless instrument and this is my take on it.

The instrument is available online [here](https://eribau.github.io/erratic-instrument)

## Run locally

If you want to run this locally you will have to start up a local server. I have used http server that comes with python when developing. With python installed simply open a terminal and go to root folder of this project then run:

```console
python -m http.server
```

This should start a server that is accesible from [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
